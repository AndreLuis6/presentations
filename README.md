## Installation
### Keynote
#### 1. Installing the theme file
To install any of the Keynote themes, simply download the theme you'd like to use and double-click on the Keynote theme file (`.kth`). This will open Keynote with the dialog box that looks like this: ![Add theme dialog box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/53050337-f50e6c00-344d-11e9-9c56-d5f3e51b19c3.png).

Click `Add to Theme Chooser`. The theme will now be available in the `My Themes` tab when you create a new presentation.

#### 2. From a pre-existing presentation
To install the theme from a pre-existing presentation, use the Keynote template file, simply download the file and double-click the Keynote file (`.key`) to open.
