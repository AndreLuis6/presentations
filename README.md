Click `Add to Theme Chooser`. The theme will now be available in the `My Themes` tab when you create a new presentation.

#### 2. From a pre-existing presentation
To install the theme from a pre-existing presentation, use the Keynote template file, simply download the file and double-click the Keynote file (`.key`) to open.
