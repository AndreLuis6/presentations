### Keynote
Keynote templates are available for download to the members of the GitHub organization on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wp3NyCYM-FsU-4MKSbPcBgIsWVgvUQy0).

![The Keynote files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/56326001-35762780-6129-11e9-915d-949763cb1186.png)

#### Creating a new presentation
A new presentation can be created by opening `github-presentation-template.key` or `github-presentation-theme.kth`.

**Note:** If you just open the regular keynote file (`.key), you will need to duplicate this for your own presentation if you do not want to override the template for later use. It is recommended that for your first presentation you open the theme file (`.kth`) and add the theme to your Keynote to use for future use.

#### Installing the Keynote theme

To install, open the theme file (`.kth`) in Keynote and click **Add to Theme Chooser**.

![Add to themes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/56325663-e11e7800-6127-11e9-9fd3-4291c937317d.png)

You will now have the theme available any time you open Keynote.

### PowerPoint
PowerPoint templates are available for download to the members of the GitHub organization on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QKiEbruGhWAY85NsEuTIEccDlAiz9qbD).

#### Creating a new presentation
A new presentation can be created using either the `.potx` file or the `.pptx` file.

##### .potx vs .pptx: What's the difference?
First of all, both the `.potx` and the `.pptx` will open and create a new document.

The main difference is that a `.potx` is a template file which will create a new presentation with the presentation system theming (slides, colors, type) already in place. The `.pptx` on the other hand will just open like a normal file and you will have to **Save a Copy** or rename for your presentation.

**Tip:** The design systems team recommends using the template(`.potx`) file as this will start a fresh document with everything loaded right away. ðŸ˜„
