### Keynote
Keynote templates are available for download to the members of the GitHub organization on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jsWOHJL0hvLfmtQBYL3-srjYhom9z7Ln).

#### Installing the Keynote theme
To install, open the theme file (.kth) in Keynote and click **Add to Theme Chooser**. You will now have the theme available any time you open Keynote.
