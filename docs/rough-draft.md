## Quote slides
Quotes are set up in two different layouts: left-aligned and centered. 

It is recommended that longer quotes be left-aligned and shorter quotes centered.

## Reactions
Reaction slides use the GitHub reaction emojis to add emphasis to a topic.

## Charts
Charts can be easily added to any slide using the built in chart features in both Keynote and Google Slides.

### Keynote

To edit the data in the chart click the chart (if not already selected) and click the Edit Chart Data button.
