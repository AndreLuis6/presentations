### Creating a new presentation

A new presentation can be created by opening `github-presentation-template-v2020.key` or `github-presentation-theme-v2020.kth`.

<Note variant="warning">
If you just open the regular keynote file (`.key`), you will need to duplicate this for your own presentation if you do not want to override the template for later use. It is recommended that for your first presentation you open the theme file (`.kth`) and add the theme to your Keynote to use for future use.
</Note>

### Installing the Keynote theme

To install, open the theme file (`.kth`) in Keynote and click **Add to Theme Chooser**.

You will now have the theme available any time you open Keynote.
