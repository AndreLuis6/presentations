title: Presentation principles
---

When creating a presentation, here is a list of principles to keep in mind.

- **You're a storyteller.** When you give a presentation, you're not just sharing data and analysis, you're also telling a story with a unique and important message.
- **Slides aren't everything.** Your slides are meant to support your presentation. But don't depend on them to the point where you're cramming every idea in your brain into text on the slide. When it comes to adding text, remember that less is more. If you find yourself with too much text, ask yourself, "What is my key message?"
- **Be concise.** Keep your content short and direct. Too much text creates a conflict for the audience as they are stuck between reading what's on the slide and listening to what you have to say. Instead of paragraphs of text, use a few bullet points to supplement your message.
